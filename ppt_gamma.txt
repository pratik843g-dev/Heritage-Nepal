Create a 14-slide professional hackathon presentation for my project "Heritage Nepal - Smart QR-Based Heritage Tourism Platform"

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Heritage Nepal is a modern web application that revolutionizes how tourists discover and explore Nepal's cultural heritage sites. Built with React.js, it combines QR code technology, GPS location services, and offline-first architecture to provide instant access to detailed information about 16 heritage sites including 9 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

KEY FEATURES:
1. QR Code Scanner - Camera and image upload scanning for instant site information
2. Near Me (GPS) - Real-time distance calculation to heritage sites with Demo Mode fallback
3. Google Maps Integration - One-click directions and map views
4. Favorites System - Save and bookmark favorite sites with offline support
5. Admin Panel - Password-protected QR code generator for site management
6. Offline-First - Works without internet using Data QR codes
7. 16 Heritage Sites - Comprehensive coverage including Pashupatinath, Boudhanath, Swayambhunath, Lumbini, Patan Durbar, Bhaktapur, Changu Narayan, Muktinath, Janaki Temple, Manakamana, Gorkha Durbar, Rara Lake, Phewa Lake, Chitwan National Park, Dhulikhel

UNIQUE INNOVATIONS:
- Dual QR System: URL QR codes (online) + Data QR codes (embedded info, works offline)
- Demo Mode: Location features work without GPS permission using demo coordinates
- Admin/Tourist Separation: Clean role-based access with password protection
- LocalStorage Favorites: No backend needed, instant save/load
- Color-coded Distance Badges: Green (<5km), Blue (5-15km), Gray (>15km)

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
Frontend: React.js, Vite, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, React Router
Libraries: html5-qrcode, qrcode.react, Lucide Icons
